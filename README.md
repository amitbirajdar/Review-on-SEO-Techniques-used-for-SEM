ABSTRACT

Today, E-commerce is booming, so is the number of
sales on online market as compared to the offline market which is
almost constant and also saturated. There are two types of
websites in today’s market, first, the genuine websites trying to
make their mark in market and second, company websites with
good brand name who already have a head start because of their
brand value. These websites are always competing against each
other in the market, but the website with a large customer base is
obviously the one which is making large profits. So this narrows
down the whole discussion to one point, customers! When a
regular customer with no prejudice about the online websites
makes a search on the search engine that is where it all starts, the
results showing numerous of websites but in a specific order and
the customer tends to select his website from the first few options.
This is what we are going to discuss in the paper that how does
your website get in those first few results. Also, this huge increase
in the number of websites has led to creation of a new industry,
